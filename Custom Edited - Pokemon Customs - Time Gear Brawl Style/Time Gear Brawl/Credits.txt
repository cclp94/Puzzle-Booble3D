Time Gear from Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, Brawl-styled

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
I made this after studying the truly inspirational 3D artwork in Brawl.
The simple yet interesting design of the Time Gear made it a fun little project to work on.
Since I figure this could make a good replacement for the Timer item, I made a low-poly version as well.
The model was not made to any particular scale, so feel free to resize it as needed.
